freelib-djatoka (version 1.1.0)      https://github.com/ksclarke/freelib-djatoka


================================================================================
INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

This package, freelib-djatoka, is a fork of the adore-djatoka JP2 image server.
It was created in an attempt to provide an easy way to run djatoka from a
Maven/Jetty setup.  Once you've checked the package out using git, installing
and running the program should be as simple as typing: mvn jetty:run-exploded

To confirm it's working, go to http://localhost:8888 and click the Update Image
button (an image should then appear at the top of the page).  Right now, only
the Linux amd64 configuration has been verified as working.  If you would like
to confirm that the program works on another platform this would be appreciated
(contact the email address below if you do, thanks!)

There may also be other differences from the original project.  Planned changes
include testing, pre-caching, and batch ingest plugins.  This package is in
development and shouldn't be confused with the real adore-djatoka image server.
