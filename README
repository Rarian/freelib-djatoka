freelib-djatoka (version 1.1.0)      https://github.com/ksclarke/freelib-djatoka


================================================================================
INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

This package, freelib-djatoka, is a fork of the adore-djatoka JP2 image server.
It was created in an attempt to provide an easy way to run djatoka from a
Maven/Jetty setup.  Once you've checked the package out using git (and have
Maven2 installed - http://maven.apache/org), installing and running the program
should be as simple as typing:

  MAVEN_OPTS="-Djava.library.path=target/lib" mvn jetty:run-exploded

There is a test page where you can confirm that freelib-djatoka is running, but
before you visit that you should run the ingester so you'll have a JP2 to view.

  To start the ingest of TIFF files, go to --> http://localhost:8888/ingest

This will start a background process that ingests the files in the djatoka
ingest data directory (there are just two in the sample data directory).

  To check on the ingest status, revisit --> http://localhost:8888/ingest

After you've run the ingest (which will just take a second with two files), you
can confirm the JP2 viewer is working.

  To confirm it's working, test it out at --> http://localhost:8888

Right now, only the Linux amd64 configuration has been verified as working.  If
you would like to confirm that the program works on another platform this would
be appreciated (contact the email address below if you do, thanks!)


================================================================================
Configuration
================================================================================

freelib-djatoka will ingest TIFF files in a specified TIFF directory.  It will
also store JP2s and derivative JPEG files to the file system.  To configure all
this, the project's pom.xml needs to be updated to match your local system.  In
the 'properties' element change the following three properties to suit your file
system, for instance:

	<djatoka.ingest.data>/usr/local/data/images/tiffs</djatoka.ingest.data>
	<djatoka.jp2.data>/usr/local/data/images/jp2s</djatoka.jp2.data>
	<openurl.cache.dir>/usr/local/data/images/cache</openurl.cache.dir>
	
These properties can be overwritten in the 'profiles' section if you are using
something other than a Linux system.  You can also override the default values
(without touching the POM) by adding them to ${MAVEN_HOME}/conf/settings.xml

Currently, the POM file is configured to use sample directories in the project's
directory structure.  You'll probably want to change this when you run your own
instance.


================================================================================
Optional Apache Configuration
================================================================================

The freelib-djatoka image server is designed to run from Jetty at a domain like
http://images.domain.edu/ (or http://images.domain.edu:8888/). If you want to
run freelib-djatoka behind Apache at a URL like http://www.domain.edu/djatoka,
you will need a little extra Apache configuration.  The below is a snippet that
can be put into your virtual host configuration to enable this.

    ProxyRequests Off

    <Proxy *>
        Order deny,allow
        Allow from all
    </Proxy>

    # Below assumes you aren't serving another /css, /javascript, etc.

    ProxyPass /djatoka http://localhost:8888
    ProxyPassReverse /djatoka http://localhost:8888
    ProxyPass /css http://localhost:8888/css
    ProxyPassReverse /css http://localhost:8888/css
    ProxyPass /javascript http://localhost:8888/javascript
    ProxyPassReverse /javascript http://localhost:8888/javascript
    ProxyPass /images http://localhost:8888/images
    ProxyPassReverse /images http://localhost:8888/images
    ProxyPass /view.xsl http://localhost:8888/view.xsl
    ProxyPassReverse /view.xsl http://localhost:8888/view.xsl
    ProxyPass /view http://localhost:8888/view
    ProxyPassReverse /view http://localhost:8888/view
    ProxyPass /resolve http://localhost:8888/resolve
    ProxyPassReverse /resolve http://localhost:8888/resolve

    # OR you could just use (which assumes you aren't serving other things)
    
    ProxyPass /djatoka http://localhost:8888
    ProxyPassReverse /djatoka http://localhost:8888
    ProxyPass / http://localhost:8888/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8888/

    # You only need one ProxyPass/ProxyPassReverse section (above), not both


================================================================================
DEVELOPMENT TIPS
================================================================================

The Jetty server must be started with `mvn:run-exploded` to include the native
libraries, but this introduces a wrinkle into the development process because
the Jetty Maven plugin will not detect changes to static files (HTML, CSS, etc.)
when run-exploded is used (you also can't configure it to use scanTargets).

So, one way to work around this issue, when editing the static files, is to have
a separate terminal window open in which you can run:

	mvn -q package -Dmaven.test.skip=true

This will move the changed static files into the directory that run-exploded
uses as its source.  You can ignore the error message about the missing
MAVEN_OPT parameter; that's only needed when starting Jetty as the web server.
