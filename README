  Freelib Djatoka Image Server
=================================================================================

  The FreeLib Djatoka Image Server is a fork of the aDORe-djatoka image server.
The original fork (which attempted to simplify the use of Djatoka) is still
available as an independent module within this project (it's called 'djatoka'
and has its own README), but a substantial revision of the project and its
structure is underway.  Until this revision reaches a point of stability, I'd
recommend you investigate the master branch (not, this, the 'develop' branch).
