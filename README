  Freelib Djatoka Image Server
=================================================================================

The FreeLib Djatoka Image Server is a fork of the aDORe-djatoka image server.
The original fork (which attempted to simplify the use of Djatoka) is still
available, as an independent module within this project (it's called 'djatoka'
and has its own README), but a substantial revision of the project and its
structure is underway.  Until this revision reaches a point of stability, I'd
recommend you investigate the master branch (not, this, the 'develop' branch).

The new version of this project uses git submodules to pull in the OpenJPEG
project.  Once you've cloned this repository and checked out the 'develop'
branch, you'll need to run the following commands (before the OpenJPEG code
will be pulled in):

  git submodule init
  git submodule update

I mention this mostly as a reminder to myself because I'm new to git submodules
and will probably forget it.  With a submodule, the developer can update to the
latest version of the code by typing:

  cd <module_name> (in our case, openjpeg)
  git update
  cd ..
  git add <module_name>
  git commit -m 'Updated <module_name> to latest version'
