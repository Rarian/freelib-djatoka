# Licenses relevant to FreeLib-Djatoka

### The Kakadu Binaries License

As stated in the README, FreeLib-Djatoka redistributes the proprietary Kakadu binaries.  This is allowed under the Kakadu license.  Jon Stroop (from Princeton) has also confirmed this is an acceptable use of the binaries (for his project [Loris](https://github.com/pulibrary/loris)) in an email with the Kakadu owners.  The transcript of his email exchange is [included](kdu_license_inquiry.eml) in this 'licenses' directory, and also available from [Loris' GitHub repository](https://github.com/pulibrary/loris).
