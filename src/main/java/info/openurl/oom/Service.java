 * from the web. To use another analogy, if the business logic is a coat, and OpenURL is a coatrack, this class
 * represents a loop of cloth sewn into the collar of the coat.
 * <p />
 * Installing new Services can be as easy as dropping them on the classpath, if your Transport is smart enough to deduce
 * the package and classname from information in the HttpServletRequest. If the Transport can't deduce everything it
 * needs from the HTTP request, it could use a config file to locate and configure Service classes instead.
