 * Transports are responsible for parsing information contained in a HttpServletRequest and representing it in the
 * OpenURL model. Each implementation of this interface should be able to deal with a particular pattern of HTTP
 * requests.
 * <p />
 * Analysis: I didn't fully understand or appreciate Transports for the longest time. I now understand that they
 * represent the class responsible for taking an HTTP request and transforming it into OpenURL terms. This means it is
 * possible to create Transports capable of interpreting any web service request in existence.
 * <p />
 * Hallelujah! I don't have to worry about url_ver=Z39.88-2004 and rft_id's anymore!
