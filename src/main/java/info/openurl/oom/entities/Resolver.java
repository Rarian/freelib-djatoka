/**
 * Resolver doesn't have a convenient synonym like most of the others. Its purpose is to decouple the content of a
 * request from any specific Resolver. This is a great benefit in relation to OpenURL's roots in citation linking, but
 * it is the source of considerable confusion for everyone else. Generally speaking, I would expect this information to
 * be part of the server's configuration rather than have it passed in from the client. If you disagree, you will
 * probably want to use one of the unfriendly Transports described in the OpenURL spec that are ready to accommodate it:
 * openurl-by-ref, openurl-by-val, or openurl-inline. This information would be difficult to represent in Transports
 * that can be understood by mere mortals. Normal Transports will probably want to assign a value of null whenever they
 * encounter a Resolver variable.
 * <p />
 * If you <em>are</em> tempted to use this Entity, consider including another ServiceType in the ContextObject instead.
 * This ServiceType should contain an info.openurl.oom.Service instantiation to deal with the situation along with URL
 * descriptors indicating alternate resolvers.
