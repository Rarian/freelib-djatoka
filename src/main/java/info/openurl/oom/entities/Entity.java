    /**
     * Get a sequence of descriptors for this entity. Use the instanceof
     * operator to select desired descriptor types from the list.
     * <p />
     * Analysis: The OpenURL specification defines a set of abstractions to
     * represent descriptors: Identifier (URI), By Value Metadata, By Reference
     * Metadata, and PrivateData (everything else). To be fair, these represent
     * categories that are useful for the handful of transports defined by the
     * spec in a language independent way. In contrast, OOM-J doesn't need to be
     * operationally constrained by language independence and shouldn't feel
     * obligated to give special status to the quirky descriptors used by legacy
     * Transports.
     * <p />
     * Normal Transports can completely ignore this whole mess: any Java Object
     * is a legitimate descriptor. Unfortunately, the XML Schemas used to
     * document OpenURL applications reflect this bias, but it is easy enough to
     * dumb our Java Object descriptors down when the time comes to register the
     * application.
     * <p />
     * As a consequence, the OOM model does NOT provide a Descriptor interface
     * to encapsulate the four types of descriptors enumerated in the OpenURL
     * 1.0 spec: Identifier, By Value Metadata, By Reference Metadata, and
     * PrivateData. As described below, every Java Object qualifies as a
     * legitimate descriptor one way or another, so why create an abstraction
     * for something that is already abstract?
     * <p />
     * Identifier is <em>not</em> modeled in OOM because it is functionally
     * equivalent to the URI class and there is no sense in creating an
     * Identifier abstraction for a single class of objects.
     * <p />
     * Interfaces <em>are</em> provided for By Value Metadata and By Reference
     * Metadata because they are generally useful and, unlike URI, there is no
     * native Java class that represents them unambiguously.
     * <p />
     * PrivateData is <em>not</em> modeled because it is functionally equivalent
     * to Java's Object class and there is no good reason to create an
     * abstraction for something that is already abstract.
